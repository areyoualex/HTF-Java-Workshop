#Java Workshop Timing Guidelines

This is a guideline to fit this workshop in an hour. This is for the Hack the Fog
Java workshop, specifically.

## Logistics overview

Everyone should have a laptop. The style of this workshop is follow along with the
speaker, but with a little more flexibility. A possible way to engage the audience
and induce creativity could be grouping/pairing them up.

The current speaker should have their laptop plugged into a projector sharing
their screen with a blank repl.it workspace open on the left pane. On the right
pane, a text editor with large visible text should be open for actual typing.
To demo code, copy paste into the repl.it panel.

It is okay for the speaker to have this repository open, but it should not be visible
to the audience. If possible, have another laptop/device open for the repository
to act as a guided script (but do not just read the whole repository, only use as
a guide).

The assistant(s) should be walking around, helping people as they see fit. Do not
stand in only one area - spread out so everyone has a chance to get some help, and
actively help attendees, not passively. In between bigger sections there should be
some time (10 min?) for people to play around with code, and all presenters assist people with
whatever they decide to create. Remember to mention, "There are no dumb questions.
Even if your question is insanely specific to what you want to create, or you just
want to get some steps on how to start doing a specific thing, please just come up
to us and ask!"

##Timing

* **3min** Introduce self and name, show experience briefly. Encourage everyone to
get their laptops out.
* **4min** Overview what the workshop is about, and what people will learn.
  * "How many of you have ever used Java before? Are there any complete beginners here?"
  * Intro to Java primarily aimed at complete beginners
  * End goal - create your own text based game
  * Learn how to use variables, make methods, use if and while statements, and
  print to console.
* **5min** Start Hello World and variables section
  * "We're just going to go over the basics very quickly"
  * Ask everyone to open a browser and type in "repl.it"
  * Open up repl.it and show output on projector for those without laptop
  * Brief on boring stuff - structure of Java for at most _80-90 seconds_: 10
  seconds for class Main curly braces, 40 seconds for println() method, 10
  seconds for semicolons, 30 seconds for main() method.
    * "Does anyone want to take a guess at why there are curly brackets after
    main(), but not after println()?"
  * Add variable and explain the variable declaration for at most _20 seconds_
  * Demo printing the variable, then demo parentheses for _15 seconds_
* **8min** User console input section
  * Show all new import and console() code on-screen: make sure people are
  paying attention so they aren't lost later.
  * From now on, for each explanation of a bit of code, take around 30 seconds max.
  * Add some interaction: "can anyone guess what keyword I would use if I only
  want to do something _if_ a certain thing is true?"
  * **6min** Creative time to work in groups and help out
* **7min** Arrays and randomness section
  * Spend 2.5 minutes on the brainstorm activity. 1 minute of waiting, then 1.5
  minutes of calling on people.
  * Spend a good 3 minutes on the Math.random() code, making sure no one types it
  off or something.
  * **4 minutes** Creative time to work in groups
*
